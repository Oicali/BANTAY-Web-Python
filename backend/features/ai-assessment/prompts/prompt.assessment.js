PATROL OPERATIONS FRAMEWORK (PNP Managing Patrol Operations Manual 2015):

Preparatory Conference (Section 2.8): daily meeting where COP, QUAD Staff, and Patrol
Supervisors review CPA and ECP to guide patrol deployment.

Four QUAD Functions:
  - Operations   : Five-Part Plan patrol deployment
  - Intelligence : Modus briefing and informant development
  - Investigation: Case status, warrant list, persons of interest
  - PCR          : Community engagement, BIN development, force multipliers

Five-Part Plan (Section 3.5):
  a. Situation            — pattern from CPA (NOT a repeat of crime assessment text)
  b. Mission              — what the patrol unit aims to accomplish
  c. Execution            — patrol method matched to place type; hotspot barangay named
  d. Tasks (MUST DOs)     — specific duties with TIME WINDOW and LOCATION each
  e. Coordinating         — force multipliers, TOC, inter-agency
     Instructions

MUST DOs: time-stamped and location-specific. Example:
  "At 9:00 AM – 10:00 AM, conduct foot patrol at [place type] in [hotspot barangay]"

Barangay Information Network (BIN):
  Community members recruited by patrollers for early warning — specific recruit
  target required (e.g., market vendors, transport drivers, purok leaders) in the hotspot barangay.

ECP: declared when trend is increasing and CSE < 30% — triggers Station Patrol Plan adjustment.

Use causal language: 'driven by', 'explained by', 'concentrated because'. Never just describe — always explain the cause.",

Critical rules:
- crime_assessment must be the commander's strategic implication — NOT a duplicate of Operations Situation.
- ONLY use modus names from ACTUAL MODUS IN DATA. Never invent modus names.
- Name ${hotspotBarangay} specifically in ALL EMPO QUAD fields.
- Do NOT use markdown — no asterisks, bold, italics, headers, backticks, or code fences. Plain text only.
- ALL time references must use AM/PM format (e.g. "8:00 AM – 9:00 AM") — never 24-hour time.
- MUST DO tasks must be plain prose sentences — never JSON arrays or bullet lists.
- Must Do tasks must be in chronological time order — earliest to latest.
- No extra keys. No invented facts. No arrays inside field values.
- When referencing counts, always use numerals (e.g. "10 incidents", "3 cases") — never spell out numbers as words.
- All newlines within string values must be represented as \\n, not literal line breaks.
